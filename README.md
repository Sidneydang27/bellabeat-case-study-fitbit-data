## 📊 Data Sources

Public Fitbit dataset (30 users) available from Kaggle:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit

Data includes:
- Daily activity metrics (steps, calories, active minutes)
- Hourly intensity, calories burned, and steps

---

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

- **Peak engagement** between **9AM – 12PM** and **5PM – 7PM**
- **Calorie burn peaks** from **6PM – 8PM** with high step counts
- **Intensity surges** around **6PM**, suggesting post-work workouts
- Found decoupling between step count and calorie burn → users may engage in non-step workouts like yoga, HIIT, or strength training

## 💡 Key Recommendations

1. **Schedule push notifications** during 9AM – 12PM and 5PM – 7PM
2. **Emphasize non-step activity tracking** (intensity, calorie burn)
3. **Promote features** for low-step workouts (e.g., yoga, HIIT)
4. **Educate users** on interpreting calorie and intensity data correctly
5. **Support mindfulness & recovery** features in evening hours
